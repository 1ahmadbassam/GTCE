# GregTech Community Edition 
## The Fork
This fork is a post-EOL fork of GTCE to incorporate fixes and (possible) necessary backports from GTCEu to GTCE v.1.17.1 EOL for use with GregBlock and its assorted expansion mods (notably, GregicAdditions).

This fork is in no way related to GTCE devs, don't bother anyone but me about it.

### GregTech?
GTCE is **neither created nor maintained by GregoriusT** but was created with his knowledge and permission.

### Community Edition?
**Community Edition** is a necessary part of the **GTCE name**: 
* It is required by our permission to use the GregTech name
* It is a reminder that the ideas and design are primarily driven by the community
* It is a reminder that the implementation and work are solely provided by the community.
